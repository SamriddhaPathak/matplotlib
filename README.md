# Matplotlib Visualization Guide

Matplotlib is one of the most widely used Python libraries for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations. This repository is designed for both beginners and intermediate users who want to improve their data visualization skills by exploring practical examples and mastering Matplotlib's core features.

## Objectives
Through this repository, you will:

- Learn the basic components of a Matplotlib plot (figure, axes, labels, etc.).
- Understand various types of visualizations and their appropriate use cases.
- Discover techniques to customize plots for improved clarity and presentation.

## Installation
To use the examples in this repository, ensure you have Matplotlib installed. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy pandas
```

## Core Concepts
Before exploring different plot types, it's essential to understand the fundamental components of a Matplotlib plot:

- **Figure**: The overall container or window for the plot.
- **Axes**: The specific area within the figure where data is visualized.
- **Axis**: The x or y axis of the plot.
- **Labels**: Descriptive texts for the x-axis, y-axis, and the plot title.

For a deeper understanding, refer to the `basic_concepts.py` file in this repository.

## Plot Types Covered

### Line Plot
Represents trends or continuous data over time.

```python
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title("Line Plot Example")
plt.xlabel("X-axis Label")
plt.ylabel("Y-axis Label")
```

### Bar Plot
Displays categorical data using rectangular bars.

```python
plt.bar(categories, values)
plt.title("Bar Plot Example")
```

### Scatter Plot
Shows the relationship between two continuous variables.

```python
plt.scatter(x, y)
plt.title("Scatter Plot Example")
```

### Histogram
Represents the distribution of data by grouping it into bins.

```python
plt.hist(data, bins=10)
plt.title("Histogram Example")
```

### Pie Chart
Illustrates proportions of categories in a dataset.

```python
plt.pie(values, labels=categories, autopct='%1.1f%%')
plt.title("Pie Chart Example")
```

### Box Plot
Summarizes data distribution using minimum, Q1, median, Q3, and maximum values.

```python
plt.boxplot(data)
plt.title("Box Plot Example")
```

Each plot type is demonstrated in its corresponding Python file located in the `examples/` directory.

## Advanced Customizations
Matplotlib offers various options to enhance your plots:

- Adding titles, labels, legends, and grids.
- Adjusting plot sizes and aspect ratios.
- Styling lines, markers, and colors.
- Annotating significant points for clarity.

Example of a customized line plot:

```python
plt.plot(x, y, color='red', linestyle='--', marker='o')
plt.title("Customized Line Plot")
plt.xlabel("X-axis")
plt.ylabel("Y-axis")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

Refer to `advanced_customizations.py` for detailed examples.

## Examples
Explore the `examples/` folder for ready-to-run scripts showcasing various visualizations.

To start with a simple line plot:

```bash
python examples/line_plot.py
```
